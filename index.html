		<br> <h2> How does Euro 2020 work? </h2>
		<br> <h4 class = "underlineh4"> Qualifying </h4> 
		<h6> 20 of the teams who participated in this Euro Cup qualified directly from the qualifiers. These were the top 2 teams in each group. The group is played with two matches between each team, and the points are standard: <br> <br> 
		<ul> <li> Win - 3 points </li> <li> Draw - 1 point </li> <li> Loss - 0 points </li> </ul> 4 more teams qualified via the qualification play-offs.<br> <br>
		The teams that have now qualified for the Euro Cup are placed in a draw that determines the group stage. The group stage consists of 6 groups, each with 4 teams. Teams in the group play one game against the others, and the top 2 teams in the group qualify directly for the round of 16. 4 more teams do qualify for the knockout stage. These are the 3rd place teams that gathered the most points in the group stage, leaving 2 eliminated. 
		<br> <br>
		From this point, the tournament is a simple one-game elimination bracket. Teams play eachother, and the winners move to the next round. This process repeats until there is 1 team remaining.</h4>
